Mornin' Mimosa
Cocktails in the summer afternoon
Spent the evening hung over
Champagne for the night time blues
Cuz I got a new girl
She's nothin' like you
She don't do anything like you used to do
And I miss the thunder, in California
All the glory and wonder
Where's the southern comfort

In the winter my brother he said man find another
Keep your head up, this is summer
Funny how I had that same younger attitude
My mother said don't rush to be grown
Cuz them valley girls will always have some growin' up to do

I ain't lookin' for lookin' for love
I don't need none of that
Cuz I can't wait for you
Can't stay for you
Won't change for you
And I don't want the same things as you
Not chasin' you
Not blamin' you
But I don't want the same things

And forever goes a long way
I'm usually patient
I'm tired of waiting all the time
Usually faded all the time

I ain't lookin' for lookin' for love
Just want you to want you to know
Just for the night, I swear
I swear
If it's all you want 
Then let's go

Cuz I can't wait for you
Can't stay for you
Won't change for you
And I don't want the same things as you
Not chasin' you
Not blamin' you
But I don't want the same things
No I don't want the same things
I don't want the same things
I ain't lookin' for lookin' for love
